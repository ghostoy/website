NW.js 0.18.5 is here with Chromium 54 security update and bug fixes: High CVE-2016-5198: Out of bounds memory access in V8. Chromium updated to 54.0.2840.87 for Windows, Mac, and 54.0.2840.90 for Linux. We use the same version 54.0.2840.90 for all the 3 platforms after reviewing the changes between 54.0.2840.90 and 54.0.2840.87.

Following our release plan in 2016, we release new versions as soon as Chromium stable is updated.
